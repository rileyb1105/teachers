     <h1>Introduction</h1>
     <p>I have had a great Fall 2018 semester! I am currently in my junior year at Virginia Tech, and I am moving closer towards graduation. As a transfer student, it's been difficult to catch up on all of the classes that did not transfer over from Kutztown University. Every day, I am thankful to have the opportunity to study at Virginia Tech. I am currently taking five classes, and I am enjoying all of them. Although some classes are more difficult than others, I have learned more this semester than any other. </p>
     <h2>About my Classes</h2>
     <p>I am currently taking two classes to fulfill my major requirements, visual media and media writing. These classes have helped me better understand what public relations mean. I have learned skills in both of my classes that I will apply to my career in media. Next, I am taking a course in consumer and family finances. This class satisfies my last math class I will ever have to take! Although I am happy to leave math in the past, this has been my favorite math class I have ever taken. I am also taking a course in the history of American sexuality, and I am taking this course to fulfill my elective minor requirement. This has been one of the most interesting classes I have ever taken, and I am so happy I signed up. Finally, I am taking a course in global ethics to fulfill an area 2 requirement. I hope you enjoy my website! </p>
