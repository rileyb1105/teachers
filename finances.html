     <h1>My Professor</h1>
     <p>My professor for Consumer and Family studies is Doctor Elizabeth Goldsmith. This is Dr. Goldsmith’s first year teaching at Virginia Tech, and she previously taught at Florida State University. Dr. Goldsmith and her husband, also a college professor, moved to Virginia to be closer to their grandchildren. Dr. Goldsmith is an esteemed professor who is the author of 18 books, and four teaching awards. I have really enjoyed Dr. Goldsmith’s class, although math is my most challenging academic subject. The way Dr. Goldsmith teaches math has proven to be very effective for me. For the first time in my life, I have maintained an A in a math class. </p>
     <h2>Time and Location</h2>
     <p>The only bad thing about Consumer and Family Studies is the time and building. The class is from 9:30 - 10:45 am every Tuesday and Thursday. Although I enjoy this class, I have a hard time waking up to study math so early in the morning. Besides the time, the class is held in Litton Reaves. This is the first time I have had a class in the building, and I hope it’s my last. Litton Reaves is located at the end of the resident’s side of campus, near Lane Stadium. Since I live off campus, it’s difficult to get to the building in a timely manner. Due to the early class time and location, I have to take my regular Progress Street bus. After taking the Progress Street bus, I have to get on the Hokie Express at Newman Library, and two stops later I end up at Litton Reaves. Despite the downsides, I am very happy to be enrolled in this section of math.</p>
     <h3>Course Work</h3>
     <p>In Consumer and Family Studies, our class learns that math is applicable to life post-college. At the start of the semester, we learned about budgeting. Although budgeting seems like common knowledge, many people struggle with spending too much money. In the same unit, we also learned how to calculate our net worth. Next, we studied the benefits and disadvantages of credit and debt. Personally, I believe this was the most important subject we have studied in the class thus far. Virtually, almost everyone has credit cards and it’s important to know how to appropriately use credit cards so you don’t end up in debt. Additionally, we learned about the burdens of student debt and how to pay them off in a timely manner after graduation.Our class has learned a number of important aspects of financial planning, such as investments, major consumer purchases, and taxes. All of the lessons I learned in Dr. Goldsmith’s class has made me more financially aware. I also feel prepared to enter the “adult world” post-graduation. I feel confident in the lessons I learned in Consumer and Family Studies so that I can be a financially independent working-adult one day. Thank you to Dr. Goldsmith for a great semester, and I can’t wait to end the semester on a high note!</p>
