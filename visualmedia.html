     <h1>My Professor</h1>
     <p>One degree requirement for communications majors is successfully completing the visual media class. This semester, I am taking visual media with Dr. Carlos Evia. Dr. Evia earned his Ph.D. from Texas Tech University. Prior to studying at Texas Tech, Dr. Evia completed his undergraduate and masters degree in Mexico. Throughout his professional career, Dr. Evia has made strides in communications studies and rightfully earned high accomplishments. Dr. Evia currently works for the communications department at Virginia Tech. Dr. Evia has multiple publications including a book, various articles, and sponsored research. In May 2017, Dr. Evia won the Frank R. Smith Award for Distinguished Article in the Journal of Technical Communication. Dr. Evia is married and has a little girl named Sophia. </p>
     <h2> About the Course</h2>
     <p>With Dr. Evia leading the visual media course, our class has crucial communication skills. Since our class is small, we have all gotten to know each other's names and frequently have friendly conversations. This course applies to all of the different sections of communications studies, such as public relations. One goal of visual media introduce the skills that are required of communication majors. To study the skills in communications, Dr. Evia divided the class into four separate modules. Creating separate modules helps students focus on one area of communications at a time. I like this style of learning because if a module is too overwhelming, or if you donâ€™t like a particular unit, it will be done in a couple of weeks. </p>
     <h3> Course Work</h3>
     <p> The topic for module 1 is page layout. Module 1 focuses on the tools needed to create a good design in communications and media. We used the tools learned in module 1 for our first group assignment. Teams of four were tasked with designing the cover and a two-page layout for a magazine that we created ourselves. All of the modules in visual media utilize applications from the Adobe Creative Cloud, so we used Indesign Pro to make our page layout. Although using Indesign was difficult, I still enjoyed this project. In Module 2, our class moved to photographic composition. Module 2 was my favorite unit we studied this semester. Our task for module 2 was to create 10-12 high-quality images using a DSLR camera. For my pictures, I shot all around the Virginia Tech campus. I was really impressed with the quality of my images! I was able to makes the pictures look better by using Adobe Photoshop. After working with the photographic composition project, our class worked on the video report. This was our second group project in the course and I worked with my same group from module 1. This project was the most difficult assignment because it required a lot of work outside of class. My team did a fantastic job creating a funny video about transportation at Virginia Tech. To develop our video, our team used Adobe Premiere. We also created Halloween videos to prepare ourselves for the big project. We are now working in our final module, the web presence project. Although learning code is difficult, it has been a rewarding learning experience. Working with Dr. Evia has been a great experience this semester! I look forward to applying the lessons I learned in visual media into my future academic and professional career. </p>
