     <h1>My Professor</h1>
     <p>This semester, I am taking a class called Sexuality in American History with Dr. Marian Mollin. Dr. Mollin works in the history department and has expertise in women and gender in the U.S. and history of social movements. Dr. Mollin has published several textbooks and books throughout her academic career. Dr. Mollin is also the winner of the Alumni Award for Excellence in Teaching from Virginia Tech in 2016. Dr. Mollin is originally from New York, and I have enjoyed hearing stories from her childhood throughout the semester. Last semester, when I was searching for another class to take for the Fall 2018 semester, I found this class on the Virginia Tech timetable. I took a similar class last semester, Human Sexuality, and I really enjoyed that class. Another reason I chose to take this class is because of my minor. All students studying communications at Virginia Tech are required to dual major, create a cognate or a minor. I am currently pursuing a minor in Diversity and Community Engagement along with my major in Public Relations. Sexuality in American History is offered as an elective course in my minor, and that is why I am enrolled in this course.</p>
     <h2>Course Work</h2>
     <p>Dr. Mollin’s class has opened my eyes to what American sexuality looked like throughout history.  After studying the colonial time period, I learned about the rigid sexual roles and identities that ruled America. Sexuality was condemned unless in marriage, a common theme throughout history. Engaging in sexual acts outside of marriage could lead to a number of consequences, even death. After studying colonial America, our class focused on antebellum America. Although sexuality was more openly expressed through letters, Americans still faced consequences for breaking regular sex norms. After studying antebellum America, our class studied modern American sexuality. During the early 1920s-1950s, our class focused on birth control and the techniques used to prevent unwanted pregnancy. I was amazed to see the lengths at which women went to prevent pregnancy. </p>
     <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
     <p>One of the requirements in Dr. Mollin’s class is reading multiple books. One of the books assigned with the course is Gay New York by George Chauncey. This book revealed a lot the gay culture in New York during the 1890s-1940s. A common belief is that homosexuality was never talked about, but Chauncey revealed this isn’t true. Chauncey used historical documents to prove homosexuality was openly discussed in publications. Besides the book, I learned a lot about the repression Americans have felt over history over sexual preference. People who didn’t adhere to the sexual norms, heterosexual couples, faced life-altering consequences. One of the saddest things I learned in this class was being gay was illegal, and multiple historical documents made it clear being gay wasn’t accepted.</p>
