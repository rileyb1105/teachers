     <h1>My Professor</h1>
     <p>This semester, I am taking a class called Sexuality in American History with Dr. Marian Mollin. Dr. Mollin works in the history department and has expertise in women and gender in the U.S. and history of social movements. Dr. Mollin has published several textbooks and books throughout her academic career. Dr. Mollin is also the winner of the Alumni Award for Excellence in Teaching from Virginia Tech in 2016. Dr. Mollin is originally from New York, and I have enjoyed hearing stories from her childhood throughout the semester. </p>
     <h2>My Minor</h2>
     <p>Last semester, when I was searching for another class to take for the Fall 2018 semester, I found this class on the Virginia Tech timetable. I took a similar class last semester, Human Sexuality, and I really enjoyed that class. Another reason I chose to take this class is because of my minor. All students studying communications at Virginia Tech are required to dual major, create a cognate or a minor. I am currently pursuing a minor in Diversity and Community Engagement along with my major in Public Relations. Sexuality in American History is offered as an elective course in my minor, and that is why I am enrolled in this course.</p>
